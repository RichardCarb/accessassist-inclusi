## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Focus Management Issues
**Problem:** Focus gets lost when content changes
**Solution:** Programmatically manage focus to appropriate elements

**Problem:** Focus indicators not visible in high contrast mode
**Solution:** Use system colors and ensure adequate border thickness

### Screen Reader Issues
**Problem:** Dynamic content changes not announced
**Solution:** Use ARIA live regions with appropriate politeness levels

**Problem:** Complex interactions confusing for screen reader users
**Solution:** Provide clear instructions and alternative interaction methods

### Form Accessibility Issues
**Problem:** Error messages not associated with fields
**Solution:** Use aria-describedby to link errors to form controls

**Problem:** Required field indicators not accessible
**Solution:** Include "required" in label text and use aria-required
