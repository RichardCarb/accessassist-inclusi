## üìã Development Guidelines

### Accessibility Guidelines

#### WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance
- **Perceivable**: Text alternatives, captions, color contrast
- **Operable**: Keyboard accessible, no seizures, time limits
- **Understandable**: Readable, predictable, input assistance
- **Robust**: Compatible with assistive technologies

#### Code Requirements
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Color contrast ratio ‚â• 4.5:1 for normal text, ‚â• 3:1 for large
- Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
- Screen reader friendly component names and descriptions
- Support for reduced motion preferences

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces for all props
- Avoid `any` types - use specific types or `unknown`
- Document complex functions with JSDoc comments

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle loading and error states accessibly
- Include `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` where needed

#### CSS & Styling
- Use Tailwind utility classes consistently
- Follow the established design system
- Test responsive design on all screen sizes
- Ensure touch targets are ‚â• 44px

#### Accessibility Implementation
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - accessible button
<Button
  onClick={handleSubmit}
  aria-label="Submit complaint to company"
  disabled={isLoading}
>
  {isLoading ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
</Button>

// ‚ùå Bad - missing accessibility features
<div onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</div>
```

#### Voice Input Support
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - voice input ready
<Textarea
  value={input}
  onChange={setInput}
  placeholder="Describe your issue (voice input available)"
  aria-label="Issue description"
/>
<VoiceInputButton onResult={setInput} />

// ‚ùå Bad - no voice alternative
<textarea onChange={setInput} />
```

#### Sign Language Integration
- Ensure camera permissions are handled gracefully
- Provide fallback text input methods
- Display clear error messages for camera issues
- Support both gesture recognition and manual text input

### Testing Requirements

#### Before Submitting PR
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] ESLint passes with no warnings
- [ ] Components render without console errors
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout
- [ ] Screen reader announces all important changes
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Voice input works on supported elements
- [ ] Camera/sign language features handle permissions properly

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Tab through entire interface
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA recommended)
- [ ] Verify high contrast mode works
- [ ] Check reduced motion setting
- [ ] Test voice input functionality
- [ ] Verify sign language detection (if applicable)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Check with keyboard-only navigation

#### Browser Testing
- Chrome/Edge (primary)
- Firefox
- Safari (macOS/iOS)
- Mobile browsers

## üß™ Testing Tools

### Automated Testing
