### Project Classification & Approach
**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state management)

**Primary User Activity**: Creating (complaint documents) with guided assistance

### Thought Process for Feature Selection
**Core Problem Analysis**: Traditional complaint systems exclude users with disabilities through phone-only support, inaccessible forms, and lack of alternative communication methods.

**User Context**: Users need to file complaints when frustrated or distressed, making accessibility even more critical during these emotional moments.

1. Choose input method (text/voice/sign language)
2. Guided intake through structured questions
3. AI-generated professional complaint draft
4. Export/send through preferred channel
5. Track status and deadlines

**Visual Metaphors**: Shield (protection), accessibility symbols, clear pathways
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean and focused - complex legal processes made simple

#### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Professional blue with accessible accent colors
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) - trust and professionalism
**Secondary Colors**: Warmer blue-grays for supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Amber (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - highlighting important actions
**Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, amber draws attention without alarm
**Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast minimum)

#### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and UI elements
**Font Personality**: Professional, highly legible, accessible to dyslexic users
**Readability Focus**: Grade 8 reading level, generous line spacing, optimal line length
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing system based on 1.25 scale ratio

#### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Primary actions prominently featured, secondary options clearly available

**Grid System**: Card-based layouts with consistent spacing and alignment
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that scales up elegantly
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough information to be helpful without overwhelming

#### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates progress, state changes, and provides feedback
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical feedback (loading, errors) animated; decorative effects minimal
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Respects reduced motion preferences, enhances rather than distracts

#### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for content grouping
- Progress bars for multi-step processes
- Tabs for input method selection
- Badges for status indicators
- Clear buttons with distinct visual hierarchy

**Component Customization**: 
- High contrast borders on focus states

- Clear visual feedback for all interactions

**Component States**: All interactive elements have clear hover, focus, active, and disabled states

**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency and clarity

**Spacing System**: 8px base unit with 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px scale

#### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent patterns
**Style Guide Elements**: Typography scale, color palette, spacing system, interaction patterns
**Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card spacing, button sizing, and content hierarchy

#### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance minimum, AAA where possible
**Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, clear headings structure
**Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality available via keyboard
**Voice Input**: Web Speech API integration for voice recognition

- Network connectivity issues during video processing
- Browser compatibility with media recording
- Large video file handling

**Edge Case Handling**: 
- Graceful fallbacks when permissions are denied
- Offline capability for draft creation
- Progress indicators for video processing
- File size limits and compression

**Technical Constraints**: 
- Browser media API availability
- File storage limitations
- Processing time for real-time sign language recognition

### Implementation Considerations
**Scalability Needs**: 
- Video storage and processing capabilities
- AI processing for real-time sign language recognition with gesture accuracy
- User data privacy and retention

**Testing Focus**: 
- Accessibility testing with real assistive technologies
- Cross-browser media recording compatibility
- Performance with large video files

**Critical Questions**: 
- How to handle real-time sign language recognition accuracy and edge cases?
- What fallbacks for unsupported browsers?
- How to ensure video privacy and security?

### Reflection
This approach uniquely serves disabled users by providing genuine choice in communication methods rather than afterthought accommodations. The combination of voice, text, and real-time sign language recognition with AI-powered hand tracking creates truly inclusive access to complaint processes.

The focus on guided intake and AI assistance levels the playing field, ensuring all users can create professional, effective complaints regardless of their writing skills or legal knowledge. The real-time feedback during sign language input provides immediate validation and builds confidence.

What makes this solution exceptional is treating accessibility as the foundation rather than an add-on, creating an experience that's better for everyone while being essential for many.
