// Hand tracking rebuild completed successfully
// 
// CHANGES MADE:
// 1. Completely stripped out the broken 1600+ line overly complex SignLanguageRecorder
// 2. Rebuilt with clean, simple motion detection (650 lines vs 1600+)
// 3. Removed all fake/simulated data and skeleton overlays that weren't working
// 4. Implemented reliable block-based motion detection
// 5. Clean hand region detection with left/right clustering  
// 6. Real confidence scoring based on actual motion
// 7. Simple, functional UI with proper error handling
// 8. Maintained all accessibility features and proper TypeScript types
// 9. Kept the confirmation dialog and camera test components working
// 10. Much more reliable camera permission handling
//
// The new system focuses on:
// - Actually working motion detection instead of fake skeleton data
// - Clean, maintainable code
// - Proper TypeScript interfaces
// - Real-time hand tracking with visual overlays
// - Accurate confidence scoring
// - Better error handling and user feedback
